        B. Each row on the table is a link to bring the user to a bug details page

        C. A + icon opens a form to add a new bug

        D. A button inside the row allows marking a bug complete

3. A bug details page displays all the details of the selected bug

        A. An edit button opens a form to edit any of the bugâ€™s attributes

        B. A close button marks the bug closed

        C. An assign button brings up a list of users that can be assigned to this bug

4. User homepage/dashboard that displays all the users in a table with relevant information like number of bugs assigned, bug hours, etc
        A. Each user row in the table is a link to the user details page

        B. A + icon opens a form to add a new user (post MVP)

        C. A remove button for each user allows a user to be removed (post MVP)

5. A user details page displays all the details of the selected user
        A. An edit button to edit the user fields (postMVP)

if (menuType === 'unassignedBugs') {
		const unassignedBugs = allBugs.filter((bug) => !bug.assigned)
		menuArray = unassignedBugs.map((bug) => {
			return {
				id: bug._id,
				name: bug.bugName,
				userId: selected._id,
				bugId: bug._id
			}
		})
	}
```

## Issues and Resolutions

**ERROR**: Issue running npm run deploy. It was not working correctly. All it was displaying was the README.md.

                              
**RESOLUTION**: There were typos in package.json that caused the error. The changes were made, switched to main then ran npm run deploy. The following step was to check that our repositories "Settings" that the "Pages" branch is set to gh-pages. We were then able to successfully deploy.
